# Data science through code

Purpose of the code:

- To answer a question, or make a prediction

- To make it easier to reproduce and improve analyses

- To collaborate with others on shared projects

- To distribute findings easily

- To distribute useful functions internally or with the community

# Data science through code

Code is written in the service of analysis

It is a means to an end, but it is also an artifact

# Data science through code

Characteristics of good code:

- Reliability

- Reproducibility

- Flexibility

- Longevity

- Scalability

# Code quality matters

How do we determine the quality of our code?

--

- Execution feedback

- User feedback

--

- Measure it with **tests**: functional, integration, performance

# Code quality matters

Measure it with **tests**: functional, integration, performance

Make this part of your regular development cycle for: 

--

  - Faster updates

  - Quick feedback on impact of changes

  - Visibility into internal dependencies

  - Easily trace the function, scope, and meaning of code

---

class: panel-narrow-slide, left

# Writing tests

- **Ideally**, cover all code paths

- **Practically**, start with the major functions, inputs, and integration points

--

- Run manual tests in the console during development

- Convert them to coded tests when the basic functionality is established

--

An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.

# `testthat`

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Install the released version from CRAN

# Create ‘tests/testthat.R’ and ‘tests/testthat/’, and adding testthat to the suggested packages in the package DESCRIPTION
# install.packages("usethis")
usethis::use_testthat()

# Create a new test file
# Create ‘tests/testthat/test-<name>.R’ and open it for editing

An example of a test file from the stringr package:

```
context("String length")
library(stringr)

test_that("str_length is number of characters", {
  expect_equal(str_length("a"), 1)
  expect_equal(str_length("ab"), 2)
  expect_equal(str_length("abc"), 3)
})

test_that("str_length of factor is length of level", {
  expect_equal(str_length(factor("a")), 1)
  expect_equal(str_length(factor("ab")), 2)
  expect_equal(str_length(factor("abc")), 3)
})

test_that("str_length of missing is missing", {
  expect_equal(str_length(NA), NA_integer_)
  expect_equal(str_length(c(NA, 1)), c(NA, 1))
  expect_equal(str_length("NA"), 2)

# Development workflow

Once you’re set up, the workflow is simple:

1. Modify your code or tests.

2. Test your package with Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + T in RStudio, or `devtools::test()` in the console.

3. Repeat until all tests pass.

# Testing considerations

User experience

- Expected results for each function
- Common mistakes or typos

.pull-left[
Test coverage

- External interfaces
- Fragile code
- Input types
]
.pull-right[
Test design

- One test per behavior
- One test per bug

# Profit!

But remember:

The tests won't **ensure** high quality in your script or application; they just **verify** it when it's there.

# Next steps

- Start small, and give it a go
- Look for opportunities to improve the functional code to be more testable, and therefore, more maintainable
- Make a habit of running all the tests locally before checking in code
  - If you're not already using source control, see Jenny Bryan's [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/)
- Add more tests over time
- Integrate tests into Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline, if applicable
- Bask in the warm glow of reliability, maintainability, and transparency
